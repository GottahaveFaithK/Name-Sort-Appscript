# Name-Sort-Appscript
This project was created when I was working on a spreadsheet with a few other people, and we wanted to be able to sort the spreadsheet by first and last name. Unfortunately, while google sheets allows you to sort alphabetically by column, we had already typed over 600 first and last names into column A, and didn't want to redo all that effort.
So, I created an appscript extension that created a Sort Menu, which could sort the sheet by column A alphabeticallly, sorting it by first name. Then I created a second function which would grab the last name (and ignore any middle names listed), and then sort the sheet alphabeitcally by last names.

Later we added an option to sort by town.
